/- Definition 2.2: the textbook notion of a closed extended-real-valued function is the
canonical predicate `LowerSemicontinuous`; for `EReal`-valued functions, mathlib identifies this
with closedness of the epigraph. -/

-- Proof sketch: if `extendedIndicator C` is lower semicontinuous, then the zero slice of its
-- closed epigraph recovers `C`; conversely, if `C` is closed then `Cᶜ` is open, so the indicator
-- presentation `Set.indicator Cᶜ (fun _ ↦ ⊤)` is lower semicontinuous by the canonical mathlib
-- indicator theorem.
